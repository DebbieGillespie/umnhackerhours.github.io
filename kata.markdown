## UMN Hacker Hours: Code Kata Group

At a Code Kata group meeting we'll review and discuss solutions to whatever kata the group has chosen to tackle. Katas can be solved in any language, so you can work in your language of choice.

Kata can be an excellent way to hone your design skills with a language you know, or they can be a great way to learn a new language. Up to you!

The kata group is open to everyone, and you don't have to be there for every meeting.

If you plan on attending, there are a few things you can do to prepare.

#### Install Exercism

[Exercism.io](http://exercism.io/) is an excellent and free source of code kata in over 30 languages. By using exercism, it will be easy for group members to all solve the same problem using whatever language they wish.

The steps for installing Exercism are [on their site](http://exercism.io/how-it-works/newbie)
    
1. Log in with a GitHub account (real GitHub, not the U's)
1. Install the CLI
1. Configure the CLI
1. Start working on problems

Once you're set up on Exercism, let me know and I'll add you to the UMN Code Kata team: http://exercism.io/teams/umn-code-kata

If you're not interested in using Exercism, that's fine. All of the Exercism problems are available on GitHub and I'll be sending out links as part of the announcement emails.

#### Starting A Kata

If you're using Exercism, go to the command line and type

`exercism fetch [your language] [exercise name]`

Example: `exercism fetch ruby rna-transcription`

Then, in your exercism directory,

`cd [your language]/[exercise name]`

Example: `cd ruby/rna-transcription`

There should be a Readme and maybe some other files in there to get you started.

If you attended the Sandi Metz class this should all look pretty familiar. There's a suite of tests and you write the code to get the tests to pass.

If you're not using Exercism, you can find the kata in Github

1. Start at https://github.com/exercism
1. Find the repo for your language. They are all named "x[language]", so "xruby", "xjava", etc.
1. In the repo, go to 'exercises/[kata name]'
1. The description of the kata is available here: https://github.com/exercism/x-common/blob/master/[kata name].md

Get as far as you can before meetup, but you don't have to worry about completing it or having the 'best' code. It's not a competition!
