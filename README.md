## Working on the site

You can clone or fork the site and make text edits without doing anything fancy. The files that end in `.markdown` are pages on the site. The css, js and images folders are all self explanatory.

Once you're ready to share your changes, send us a pull request.

If you want to run the site locally:

- Have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/) and [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) installed on your machine.
- clone or fork this repo
- `bundle`
- `bundle exec jekyll serve -w` to run the site at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

Changes you make to the files will be reflected in the site when you refresh. More details over at [Jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/)
