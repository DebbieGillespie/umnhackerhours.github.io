We are the University of Minnesota affiliate of [Hacker Hours](http://hackerhours.org/), providing free office hours for coders looking to learn new skills, or anyone who wants to learn to code.

# What are Hacker Hours

Hacker Hours describes itself as:

- “free office hours for programming help”
- open to anyone, regardless of age or skill level
- not a class, and not a lecture

Simple as that!

## When and Where

Our first meeting will be at [Campus Code Fest](http://umn.campuscodefest.org/) on August 20th and 21st. After that we will meet regularly on campus. Details about when and where are forthcoming.

## I want to learn

Great! we are excited to have you join us. No need to make a reservation or buy a ticket. Join us at any meeting you'd like. No need to attend the entire meeting or to come to every meeting.

### What should I know in advance?

We are open to **everyone** regardless of skill level. Want to learn how to program? Perfect. Know some programming but want to improve? We can help. Expert in one language and want to learn another? Join on in..

## I want to mentor

Great! We are excited to have you help out. If you want, let us know that you're coming. Or just come to the meting and suprise us. You don't need to be at every meeting, and you don't need to be there for the whole length of the meeting. Help out as you can, when you can. 

### What should I know in advance?

Mentors can be anyone who wants to help people learn. You don't have to be some wizened expert. In fact, it's better if you're not. Someone who has just learned a skill is frequently better at teaching it than someone who has mastered it. If you are interested in help people learn then you can mentor.
